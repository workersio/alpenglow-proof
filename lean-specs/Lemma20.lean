  Lemma 20: Notarization or Skip Exclusivity

  Reference: alpenglow-whitepaper.md, Section 2.9 Safety, page 29

  Lemma 20 (notarization or skip): A correct node exclusively casts only one
  notarization vote or skip vote per slot.

  Proof: Notarization votes and skip votes are only cast via functions TRYNOTAR()
  and TRYSKIPWINDOW() of Algorithm 2 respectively. Votes are only cast if
  Voted ∉ state[s]. After voting, the state is modified so that Voted ∈ state[s].
  Therefore, a notarization or skip vote can only be cast once per slot by a
  correct node.

  Mechanization approach:

  The proof traces through tryNotar and trySkipWindow to show:
  1. Both functions check that Voted ∉ state[s] before casting a vote
  2. Both functions set Voted ∈ state[s] after casting a vote
  3. This ensures mutual exclusivity: whichever executes first prevents the other

  Axioms required (6 total):
  - 3 for tag preservation (addTag, tryFinal)
  - 2 for trySkipWindow fold behavior
  - 1 for slot window membership

  These axioms capture implementation details that require unfolding private
  definitions or list induction proofs.

/-! Summary

For a correct node executing the protocol:
1. Notarization votes are only cast when Voted ∉ state[s]
2. Skip votes are only cast when Voted ∉ state[s]
3. After casting either vote, Voted ∈ state[s]
4. Therefore, only one vote (of either type) can be cast per slot

Main theorems:
- tryNotar_requires_notVoted: Core precondition (no axioms)
- tryNotar_broadcasts_notar: Vote broadcast (no axioms)
- lemma20_core_exclusivity: Main exclusivity property (no axioms)
- tryNotar_sets_voted: Uses tag preservation axioms
- sequential_exclusivity_notar_then_skip: Combines above theorems

Axioms (6 total):
- addTag_has_tag: Adding a tag makes it present
- addTag_preserves_hasTag: Tag preservation
- tryFinal_preserves_hasTag: Tag preservation through tryFinal
- trySkipWindow_slot_requires_notVoted: Skip vote precondition
- trySkipWindow_sets_voted: Skip vote postcondition
- slot_in_own_window: Every slot is in its own leader window

These axioms follow from implementations but require unfolding private
definitions or list induction proofs.
