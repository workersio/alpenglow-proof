/- Definition 11 (certificate vote thresholds) and Table 6 from p.19-20:

    Certificate vote thresholds for different certificate types:
    - Fast-Finalization: ≥ 80%
    - Notarization: ≥ 60%
    - Notar-Fallback: ≥ 60%
    - Skip: ≥ 60%
    - Finalization: ≥ 60%

  | .notar => 60 / 100        -- Notarization: 60%
  | .notarFallback => 60 / 100 -- Notar-Fallback: 60%
  | .skip => 60 / 100         -- Skip: 60%
  | .skipFallback => 60 / 100 -- Skip-Fallback
  | .final => 60 / 100        -- Slot finalization: 60%

/- Definition 12 (storing votes in Pool) from p.20:
    "Pool stores received votes for every slot and every node as follows:
    - The first received notarization or skip vote,
    - up to 3 received notar-fallback votes,
    - the first received skip-fallback vote, and
    - the first received finalization vote."

/- Definition 13 (certificates in Pool) from p.20-21:
    "Pool generates, stores and broadcasts certificates:
    - When enough votes (see Table 6) are received, the respective certificate is generated.
    - When a received or constructed certificate is newly added to Pool,
      the certificate is broadcast to all other nodes.
    - A single (received or constructed) certificate of each type corresponding
      to the given block/slot is stored in Pool."

/- **Definition 14 (finalization)** from p.21:
    "We have two ways to finalize a block:
    - If a finalization certificate on slot s is in Pool, the unique notarized block
      in slot s is finalized (we call this slow-finalized).
    - If a fast-finalization certificate on block b is in Pool, the block b is finalized
      (fast-finalized).
    Whenever a block is finalized (slow or fast), all ancestors of the block are
    finalized first."

/- Definition 15 (Pool events) from p.21:
    "The following events are emitted as input for Algorithm 1:
    - BlockNotarized(slot(b), hash(b)): Pool holds a notarization certificate for block b.
    - ParentReady(s, hash(b)): Slot s is the first of its leader window, and Pool holds a
      notarization or notar-fallback certificate for a previous block b, and skip certificates
      for every slot s' since b, i.e., for slot(b) < s' < s."

  | BlockNotarized (s : Slot) (blockHash : Hash)
  | ParentReady (s : Slot) (parentHash : Hash)

/- **Definition 16 (fallback events)** from p.21-22:
    "Consider block b in slot s = slot(b). By notar(b) denote the cumulative stake of nodes
    whose notarization votes for block b are in Pool, and by skip(s) denote the cumulative
    stake of nodes whose skip votes for slot s are in Pool.

    The following events are emitted as input for Algorithm 1:
    - SafeToNotar(s, hash(b)): The event is only issued if the node voted in slot s already,
      but not to notarize b. Moreover:
      notar(b) ≥ 40% or (skip(s) + notar(b) ≥ 60% and notar(b) ≥ 20%).
      If s is the first slot in the leader window, the event is emitted. Otherwise, block b
      is retrieved in the repair procedure first, in order to identify the parent of the block.
      Then, the event is emitted when Pool contains the notar-fallback certificate for the
      parent as well.
    - SafeToSkip(s): The event is only issued if the node voted in slot s already, but not
      to skip s. Moreover:
      skip(s) + Σ_b notar(b) - max_b notar(b) ≥ 40%."
