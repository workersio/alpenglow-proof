# Audit Report: ChainConsistency

### 1. Code that you are auditing.
```tla
ChainConsistency == SafetyInvariant
```

### 2. The whitepaper section and references that the code represents.

This TLA+ code directly references `SafetyInvariant`, which, as established in the previous audit, corresponds to **Theorem 1 (safety)** in the whitepaper (Section 2.9, page 32).

The comments in `MainProtocol.tla` clarify the intent:
```tla
(***************************************************************************
 * Chain consistency under <20% Byzantine stake â€” restates Theorem 1 using
 * the paper's resilience assumption (Assumption 1).
 ***************************************************************************)
ChainConsistency == SafetyInvariant
```

### 3. The reasoning behind the code and what the whitepaper claims.

The code simply defines `ChainConsistency` as an alias for `SafetyInvariant`. The purpose of this is likely for readability and to provide a different conceptual name for the same underlying property. While `SafetyInvariant` is a generic TLA+ term, `ChainConsistency` is a more descriptive name that directly relates to the core property of a blockchain: maintaining a single, consistent chain of blocks.

The whitepaper's Theorem 1 is the fundamental safety guarantee, ensuring that the finalized ledger does not fork. By creating an alias, the TLA+ specification provides a clear and explicit link between the formal property (`SafetyInvariant`) and the conceptual guarantee from the whitepaper (`ChainConsistency`).

### 4. The conclusion of the audit.

The `ChainConsistency` definition is **correct**. It serves as a descriptive alias for the main `SafetyInvariant`, which correctly formalizes Theorem 1 of the whitepaper. This is a common and useful practice in TLA+ specifications to improve readability and link the formal model to the concepts in the informal specification.

### 5. Any open questions or concerns.

None.

### 6. Any suggestions for improvement.

None. This is a good use of an alias to improve the clarity of the specification.
