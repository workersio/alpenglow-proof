# üöÄ Alpenglow Protocol: A Beginner's Guide

## üìñ What is Alpenglow?

Imagine you have a group of people (validators) trying to agree on a shared ledger (blockchain). Alpenglow is a **consensus protocol** - a set of rules that ensures everyone agrees on the same transactions in the same order, even if some people are dishonest or offline.

## üéØ The Challenge We're Solving

We need to prove mathematically that Alpenglow:
1. **Never disagrees** - All honest validators see the same chain (Safety)
2. **Keeps moving forward** - New blocks keep getting added (Liveness)
3. **Tolerates bad actors** - Works even with 20% malicious validators

## üìä Challenge Requirements vs Our Implementation

### ‚úÖ **1. Votor's Dual Voting Paths (Fast 80% vs Slow 60%)**

**What it means:** Like having two roads to the same destination - a fast highway (needs 80% agreement) and a slower scenic route (needs 60% agreement).

**Where we implement it:**

| File | What it Does |
|------|-------------|
| **VoteTypes.tla** | Defines the 5 types of votes validators can cast |
| **CertificateTypes.tla** | - `FastFinalizationCert`: 80% stake = instant finalization<br>- `NotarizationCert` + `FinalizationCert`: 60% + 60% = slow finalization |
| **VotorCore.tla** | - `TryNotar()`: First vote when block arrives<br>- `TryFinal()`: Second vote for slow path |
| **AlpenglowProtocol.tla** | - `FastPathFinalization()`: 1-round finalization<br>- `SlowPathFinalization()`: 2-round finalization |

**How it works:**
```
Fast Path (1 round):
Block arrives ‚Üí 80% vote immediately ‚Üí FINALIZED! ‚úÖ

Slow Path (2 rounds):  
Block arrives ‚Üí 60% vote ‚Üí Notarized ‚Üí 60% vote again ‚Üí FINALIZED! ‚úÖ
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **2. Rotor's Erasure-Coded Block Propagation** 

**What it means:** Splitting data into pieces so you only need some pieces to reconstruct the whole (like RAID storage).

**Our approach:** We **correctly abstract this away** because:
- Rotor is about **efficiency**, not **safety**
- For safety verification, we only care that "blocks eventually arrive"
- Implementation details (shreds, erasure coding) don't affect consensus correctness

**Where it appears:**
- **BlockStructure.tla**: We model blocks as atomic units that "arrive"
- **AlpenglowProtocol.tla**: `ReceiveBlock()` action abstracts the entire Rotor delivery

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Certificate Generation, Aggregation, and Uniqueness**

**What it means:** Collecting votes into official "certificates" that prove agreement.

**Where we implement it:**

| File | Feature | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Pool.tla** | Vote Storage | - Enforces multiplicity rules (max 3 notar-fallback votes)<br>- Stores first vote of each type only |
| **Pool.tla** | `GenerateCertificate()` | Creates certificates when thresholds met |
| **Pool.tla** | `StoreCertificate()` | Ensures only ONE certificate of each type per slot |
| **CertificateTypes.tla** | Stake Counting | "Count once per slot" rule - each validator counted once even with multiple votes |

**Key Rules:**
- ‚úÖ At most ONE notarization certificate per slot
- ‚úÖ Can't have both skip and notarization certificates for same slot  
- ‚úÖ Each validator's stake counted ONCE per slot (even if they vote multiple times)

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Timeout Mechanisms and Skip Certificate Logic**

**What it means:** If a leader doesn't produce a block in time, validators "skip" that slot.

**Where we implement it:**

| File | Component | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **VotorCore.tla** | `HandleTimeout()` | Triggers skip votes when timeout expires |
| **VotorCore.tla** | `TrySkipWindow()` | Votes to skip all unvoted slots in window |
| **VotorCore.tla** | `timeouts` field | Tracks scheduled timeout for each slot |
| **Pool.tla** | `CanEmitSafeToSkip()` | Checks if safe to cast skip-fallback vote |
| **AlpenglowProtocol.tla** | `ProcessTimeout()` | System-level timeout handling |

**How timeouts work:**
```
Leader assigned slot 5 ‚Üí Timer starts ‚Üí 
If block arrives: Cancel timer, vote ‚úÖ
If timer expires: Vote to skip ‚ùå
```

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Leader Rotation and Window Management**

**What it means:** Leaders get consecutive slots (a "window") to produce blocks.

**Where we implement it:**

| File | Function | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **BlockStructure.tla** | `Leader(slot)` | Determines which validator leads each slot |
| **BlockStructure.tla** | `FirstSlotOfWindow()` | Finds first slot of leader's window |
| **BlockStructure.tla** | `WindowSlots()` | Gets all slots in same window |
| **VotorCore.tla** | `HandleParentReady()` | Sets timeouts for entire window when ready |

**Window Rules:**
- First slot needs parent from previous window
- Later slots build on previous slot in same window
- All slots in window get timeouts set together

## üîç What We're Actually Verifying

### Safety Properties (Things that must NEVER happen):

1. **No Forks**: If two validators finalize blocks, they must be in the same chain
2. **Vote Once**: Validators can only vote once per slot (initial vote)
3. **Unique Certificates**: Only one certificate of each type per slot
4. **Threshold Enforcement**: Certificates need correct stake (80% or 60%)

### Liveness Properties (Things that must EVENTUALLY happen):

1. **Progress**: New blocks keep getting finalized (after network stabilizes)
2. **No Deadlock**: Protocol doesn't get stuck

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance:

- Protocol remains safe with up to 19.9% malicious stake
- Malicious validators can:
  - Vote multiple times ‚ùå
  - Vote for conflicting blocks ‚ùå
  - Send invalid messages ‚ùå
- But they CANNOT break safety! ‚úÖ

## üéÆ How to Read Our Code

### For Non-TLA+ Users:

1. **Start with AlpenglowProtocol.tla** - See the big picture
2. **Look at "Actions"** - These are the things that can happen:
   - `ReceiveBlock` - Validator gets a block
   - `ProcessTimeout` - Timer expires
   - `FinalizeBlock` - Block becomes permanent

3. **Check Safety Properties** - These must always be true:
   ```tla
   SafetyInvariant ==  (* No conflicting chains *)
       \A validator1, validator2 :
           their chains must agree
   ```

4. **Ignore syntax details** - Focus on the logic flow

### Key Concepts Simplified:

| TLA+ Term | What it Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| `VARIABLE` | Things that change over time |
| `CONSTANT` | Configuration parameters |
| `Init` | Starting state |
| `Next` | What can happen next |
| `Invariant` | Must always be true |
| `[]` | Always (in all states) |
| `<>` | Eventually (in some future state) |

## üö¶ What This Proves

When TLC model checker runs our specification:

1. **Explores millions of states** - Every possible sequence of events
2. **Checks safety** - Ensures no bad states are reachable
3. **Verifies liveness** - Confirms progress is made
4. **Finds bugs** - If any exist, shows exact sequence to reproduce

**Result**: Mathematical proof that Alpenglow consensus is correct! üéâ
